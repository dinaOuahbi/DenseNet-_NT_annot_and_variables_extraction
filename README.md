# DenseNet-_NT_annot_and_variables_extraction

create a model to annotate slides (pancreatic cancer) ===> models and pdf file for results of annotation 
CNN evaluation on Train, validation and test set ==> Evaluation folder
Deploy model on independent dataset and extract variables from a specifc layer ==> extraction_matrixs
extract variables only from tumor tiles upper that 80% ==> T80
survival analysis on this matrixis ==> see the results in survival_analysis_results file
