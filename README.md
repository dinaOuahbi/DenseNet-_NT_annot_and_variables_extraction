Create a model to annotate slides (pancreatic cancer) ===> models and pdf file for results of annotation


CNN evaluation on Train, validation and test set ==> Evaluation folder


Deploy model on independent dataset and extract variables from a specifc layer ==> extraction_matrixs


Extract variables only from tumor tiles upper that 80% ==> T80


Survival analysis on this matrixis ==> see the results in survival_analysis_results file
